# View Finder Reimplemented

The idea of this project is to generate a view from any point on earth, looking in any direction. It is a re-implementation of the [Viewfinder Panoramas](https://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/) by Jonathan de Ferranti.

## Quick start
 - make sure you have GNU Make and CLANG compiler installed
 - compile the code using "make main" command
 - run the code with "./main > output.ppm"

Rendered image of a sphere should be saved in the `output.ppm` file.

## Ray Tracing
Ray tracing code is based on the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) tutorial by Peter Shirley, Trevor David Black and Steve Hollasch.

## DEM model
Eventually, the NASADEM  will be used as the Digital Elevation Model. NASADEM data is avialiable in multiple formats. Most likely the HGT format is sufficient for this project.
